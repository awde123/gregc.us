          <p>York had a measurable impact on the world through his couragous actions in The Great War- specifically his triumph in an attack on a German Machine Gun nest for which he recieved the Congressional Medal of Honor. Although he recieved national acclaim, to what extent did he change his community? What is his lasting impact on his hometown?</p>

          <img src="assets/nhd/dogtrot.jpg" align="middle" width="200px">
          <p>York came from humble beginnings: a two-room cabin near modern-day Pall Mall, Tennessee. As the third of eleven children from the impoverished Mrs. Mary Elizabeth and Mr. William Uriah York, the entire family had to be focused on sustainability, putting education on the back burner (Alvin only attended school for nine months). In 1911, William York passed, leaving the family in the care of the oldest remaining brother, Alvin (Alvin’s remaining brothers had been married and relocated). The stresses of supporting such a large family led to York’s eventual addiction to alcohol and increasing hostility. Thanks to his mother, he was able to pacify his attitude through a force that would play a major role in the rest of his life: Christianity. </p>

            <h3>
                <a name="rd">Religion and the Draft</a>
            </h3>
            <p>York belonged to The Church of Christ in Christian Union, a protestant congregation which placed an emphasis on the condemnation of violence, opposite York’s prior ideology. Regardless, in June 5th, 1917, York was chosen for the draft and his many attempts of nullification via conscientious objection due to religion were denied. The mandate for York to join the army was certainly an extension of a stand taken by the U.S. Government. Deeply disturbed by his present situation, York was able to obtain a 10 day leave to contemplate the morality of the situation. This led to York’s eventual acceptance of his involvement in The Great War. This would lead to the saving of hundreds of lives, despite York’s initial reservations and perfunctory participation. Religion played an major role in the York’s decisions which would directly affect the state of Tennessee, the United States, and the World. </p>

          <p>Prior to this involuntary arrangement, York had nary been more than 15 miles from his house. Now he was based across the Atlantic Ocean. His experience as a fighter and a religiously inspired training regime made York an exceptional fighter- melee and ranged. He would soon prove himself near Hill 223 on October 8th, 1918. The following is his recollection of the events leading up. <blockquote>The Germans got us, and they got us right smart. They just stopped us dead in our tracks. Their machine guns were up there on the heights overlooking us and well hidden, and we couldn't tell for certain where the terrible heavy fire was coming from ... And I'm telling you they were shooting straight. Our boys just went down like the long grass before the mowing machine at home. Our attack just faded out ... And there we were, lying down, about halfway across [the valley] and those German machine guns and big shells getting us hard.</blockquote>
